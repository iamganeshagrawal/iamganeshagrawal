### My Tech Garden ðŸŒ±

I write regular blog posts, most of which you will find on my personal website [blog.ganeshagrawal.com](https://blog.ganeshagrawal.com) and [dev.to/ganeshagrawal](https://dev.to/ganeshagrawal).

I write about things I am familiar with, things that trip up folks that I mentor, and things that I am learning.  Day to day I make things with **random ideas** using **JavaScript** and **PHP**.
